# Showcase div height should be dynamic according to navbar height, which should load off variable. Not sure of the best way to do this. Some options:
- Svelte store for var
- Pass height var to child
- CSS tricks?
- CSS superset

# Phone
- Only show fullscreen on hover
- Click images to bring up full sized modal

# Todo
- Splash links and better hover
- Project links
- Other project links
- Games
- Modal popups
- Project mobile overlay on laptop
- Project images
- Add support to disable splash or convert to header only, for standalone pages


# Other
Wayback links to old sites
Consider change background image on page change (web vs games)
